Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides a machine the ability to learn automatically from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a great field. It has applications in many fields. To become an expert in the field of machine learning, you must do a lot of projects.

In this post, I’m going to show how to build a machine learning model step by step. I’ll cover the following topics:

Loading the dataset
Understanding the dataset
Data preprocessing
Data visualization
Building a regression model
Model evaluation
Model prediction
